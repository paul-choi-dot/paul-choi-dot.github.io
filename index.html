    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a Mechanical Engineering student at UC Berkeley with hands-on experience in aerospace 
      structures, propulsion hardware, and engineering design. As Structures Lead at Space 
      Enterprise at Berkeley, I design and fabricate components for liquid and solid rocket 
      systems—including recovery hardware, composite airframes, igniters, and full test-stand 
      assemblies—supported by CAD, FEA, and machining.

     
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy working on high-impact, technical challenges — from building custom CPUs
      to analyzing structural dynamics, designing mechanical systems, and developing secure
      software pipelines. My long-term goal is to contribute to advanced aerospace
      technologies and next-generation manufacturing.
      I’ve also worked as a Design Engineer Intern at Helix Electric and served as Mechanical 
      Design Lead for NASA’s High Altitude Student Platform, contributing to flight hardware, 
      testing, and system integration. I enjoy solving complex mechanical problems, building 
      reliable hardware, and working on projects that push practical engineering forward.

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Space Enterprise Berkeley</h3>
      <p>
       Space Enterprise at Berkeley (SEB) is a student-run liquid-fueled rocket team dedicated 
       to achieving spaceflight and developing rocket technologies at the University of California, Berkeley.
       Over the past few years, SEB has launched multiple test-bed rockets and has amassed extensive technical 
       knowledge and hands-on skill in various rocket subsystems, including composite airframe manufacturing, 
       in-flight data acquisition, and propulsion. 
      </p>
      <p>
      As Structures Lead, I have led the design, build, and testing of propulsion systems including engine mount and recovery 
      mechanisms. I created detailed CAD models in Fusion 360 and performed structural simulations using ANSYS to determine 
      efficay. These projects gave me hands-on experience integrating analysis with build operations skills that translate 
      directly to design campaigns for spacecraft hardware.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Fusion 360, ANSYS Mechanical, Additive Manufacturing</p>

      <h3>NASA HASP</h3>
      <p>
       The High Altitude Student Platform (HASP), a collaborative venture of the NASA Balloon Program Office 
       and Louisiana Space Consortium, provides a launch platform for student research payloads and 
       is launched annually from the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility at Fort Sumner, New Mexico 
       to altitudes of ~120,000ft at an ascent rate of 1000 ft/min, for durations up to 20 hrs.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Mechanical Design Lead, I managed the development of a stratospheric payload, overseeing CAD design, 
        mechanical integration, and thermal control planning. I collaborated with electrical and software teams 
        to validate system interfaces and co-authored proposal documentation. This experience strengthened my 
        ability to work across disciplines, maintain precision under tight deadlines, and deliver reliable flight hardware.

      <h3>YHWH Apparel</h3>
      <p>
       YHWH Apparel is a non-profit Christian apparel brand based in Berkeley, CA. 
       Our vision is to speak truth through our apparel, empowering people to express 
       their identity as children of the Most High King, to be bold as they carry the 
       name of their Lord, and to live a life of consistency before our God. 
      </p>
      <p>
       As the current executive, I overlook the full apparel design process starting from product 
       ideation to product launch. This process involves the coordination and collaboration of 
       multiple subteams: business operations, product design, and marketing.
