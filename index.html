    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a Mechanical Engineering student at UC Berkeley with hands-on experience in aerospace 
      structures, propulsion hardware, and engineering design. As Structures Lead at Space 
      Enterprise at Berkeley, I design and fabricate components for liquid and solid rocket 
      systems—including recovery hardware, composite airframes, igniters, and full test-stand 
      assemblies—supported by CAD, FEA, and machining.

     
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy working on high-impact, technical challenges — from building custom CPUs
      to analyzing structural dynamics, designing mechanical systems, and developing secure
      software pipelines. My long-term goal is to contribute to advanced aerospace
      technologies and next-generation manufacturing.
      I’ve also worked as a Design Engineer Intern at Helix Electric and served as Mechanical 
      Design Lead for NASA’s High Altitude Student Platform, contributing to flight hardware, 
      testing, and system integration. I enjoy solving complex mechanical problems, building 
      reliable hardware, and working on projects that push practical engineering forward.

    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>Space Enterprise Berkeley</h3>
      <p>
        Designed and simulated a custom 4-bit CPU with a complete datapath,
        ALU, registers, and control logic. Implemented instruction execution,
        branching, and memory access using hardware design principles.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Logisim, Verilog (optional), MIPS fundamentals</p>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>NASA HASP</h3>
      <p>
        Performed thermal and structural FEA simulations for a small-scale
        rocket engine thrust chamber. Conducted mesh-independence studies and
        evaluated composite/metallic material performance under high loads.

      <h3>YHWH Apparel</h3>
      <p>
       YHWH was created out of a love made known, a need that was seen, 
       and a call that was heard (Psalm 107).YHWH is the tetragrammaton of 
       one of the names of God, often spoken as "Yahweh" (Exodus 3:14). 
       It was (and still is, by certain groups) regarded too holy to be spoken.
       MISSION & VISION
       Our desire is simply to share the goodness and truth of the Gospel. 
       To tell the world of the beautiful name of God that they may seek and 
       find that He is Lord and that they may discover the unconditional love 
       that is for them. Our vision is to speak truth through our apparel, 
       empowering people to express their identity as children of the Most High King, 
       and to encourage believers to be bold as they carry the name of their Lord, 
       not only on their shirts, but also on their hearts. It is also a call to live 
       a life of consistency before our God.
