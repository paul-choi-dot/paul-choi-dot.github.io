    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a Mechanical Engineering student at UC Berkeley with hands-on experience in aerospace 
      structures, propulsion hardware, and engineering design. As Structures Lead at Space 
      Enterprise at Berkeley, I design and fabricate components for liquid and solid rocket 
      systems—including recovery hardware, composite airframes, igniters, and full test-stand 
      assemblies—supported by CAD, FEA, and machining.

     
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy working on high-impact, technical challenges — from building custom CPUs
      to analyzing structural dynamics, designing mechanical systems, and developing secure
      software pipelines. My long-term goal is to contribute to advanced aerospace
      technologies and next-generation manufacturing.
      I’ve also worked as a Design Engineer Intern at Helix Electric and served as Mechanical 
      Design Lead for NASA’s High Altitude Student Platform, contributing to flight hardware, 
      testing, and system integration. I enjoy solving complex mechanical problems, building 
      reliable hardware, and working on projects that push practical engineering forward.

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <div class="project-card">
      <h3>4-bit CPU Design</h3>
      <p>
        Designed and simulated a custom 4-bit CPU with a complete datapath,
        ALU, registers, and control logic. Implemented instruction execution,
        branching, and memory access using hardware design principles.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Logisim, Verilog (optional), MIPS fundamentals</p>
